# CERN Lxplus

## Work directory

As of ~2022, CERN recommends using your `eos` directory for all work. Make a CERNBox account to get an `eos` directory: https://swan.docs.cern.ch/intro/cernbox/.

It should then show up at `/eos/user/<first letter of your username>/<username>`. You can then install conda / mamba, CMSSW releases, repositories etc. in this directory.
